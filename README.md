# Weather ETL Pipeline with Airflow, Python, MySQL & ( Power BI & Apache Supserset )

This project demonstrates a complete ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for weather data collection, processing, and visualization using openWeatherMap API, Apache Airflow, Python, MySQL and - Power BI (Windows) & Apache Supserset (Linux Ubuntu) -.

## Project Overview

Over the course of one week, I built an automated data pipeline to collect and analyze real-time weather data.  
Data was collected from a public weather API over 3 days (starting May 27, 2025) for multiple cities and processed through the following stages:

- **Extraction** using Airflow and API requests  
- **Transformation** using Pandas and Python scripts  
- **Loading** into a MySQL database  
- **Visualization** in Power BI and Apache Superset with dynamic dashboards
