# 🌦️ Weather ETL Pipeline with Airflow, Python, MySQL & Power BI

This project demonstrates a complete ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for weather data collection, processing, and visualization using Apache Airflow, Python, MySQL, and Power BI.

## 📌 Project Overview

Over the course of one week, I built an automated data pipeline to collect and analyze real-time weather data.  
Data was collected from a public weather API over 3 days (starting May 27, 2025) for multiple cities and processed through the following stages:

- **Extraction** using Airflow and API requests  
- **Transformation** using pandas and Python scripts  
- **Loading** into a MySQL database  
- **Visualization** in Power BI with dynamic dashboards

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow orchestration  
- **Python (Pandas, Requests)** – Data extraction & transformation  
- **MySQL** – Structured data storage  
- **Power BI**
